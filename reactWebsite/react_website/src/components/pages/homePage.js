      My name is Brad Muise, I am a recent graduate of the Computer Programmer/Analyst program at Conestoga College. </p>

      <p>
      I am currently seeking a career in my field of study, and this web app is here to showcase my experience and abilities I've gained at Conestoga and through my own studies. <br></br>
      Feel free to look around! Check out my projects and skills, explore what I learned at Conestoga, or view/download my Resume! <br></br>
      There is also a contact page that will have all my information for whichever way you wish to contact me!
